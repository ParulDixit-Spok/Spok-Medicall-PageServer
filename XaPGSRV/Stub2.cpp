// functions defined and used in XNPGSRV, project #2,
//  that are not used in the other projects.
//  these functions are implemented here as dummy/stub
//  functions to avoid compile errors in the other projects.

// Stub2.cpp should be included by the "other" projects
//  because meaningful implementations are contained within the
//  XNPGSRV project.
